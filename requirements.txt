# requirements.txt
# This project uses ONLY Python standard library modules:
#   - sqlite3 (database)
#   - http.server (REST API)
#   - json (serialization)
#   - logging (structured logs)
#   - signal (graceful shutdown)
#   - math (sensor calculations)
#   - random (noise generation)
#   - threading (API background thread)
#
# NO external dependencies required!
# This means: no pip install needed, no multi-stage build needed,
# and the image stays as small as possible.
#
# If you later add external packages (e.g., paho-mqtt for MQTT support),
# add them here with pinned versions:
# paho-mqtt==1.6.1
# cryptography==41.0.7
